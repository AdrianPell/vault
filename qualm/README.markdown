# Qualm
## _Machine learning (for humans)_

### Introduction

So having never participated formally in mathematics since developing a categorical fear of numbers throughout highschool,
and yet somehow ending up a software developer fascinated by machine learning and intelligent systems, I have done my fair
share of tinkering. When I wrote my first chess engine, I would have never said "Oh, it's just a derivative of a 
maximum entropy model, so that's why it can beat me instantly, but comes in 32 flavors of suck when it plays against any 
optimizing search algorithm; next time I might try a hidden Markov chain" because I wouldn't have understood any of that. 
To a large degree, I still don't.

So what Qualm is then, is a personal effort to break down the real theories of machine learning as I come to understand them, 
and make them palatable to non-practitioners of the dark arts of statistical mathematics, as only a true neophyte could. Much
of what I've found in the academic world related to machine learning seems engineered to confuse. There's the terminology and
the theoretical analysis, and above all that there's the math notation, my mortal enemy. The name Qualm comes as much from
the idea that machine learning is about navigating a sea of doubts, as it does from my uncanny ability to get queasy at the 
sight of math.

The only reason this code finds itself on github.com is because I don't know how to code any other way; stuff I do for personal 
reasons ends up as open source. I'll probably find out only later, when it's much too late, that this is some deep-seated need
for approval and serving a higher purpose. Until I resolve that, you benefit, or not. Probably the latter.

### Why, again?

Because we're drowning in oceans of data and we live in a world where most new businesses contain no defensible technology,
no "secret sauce", just things we call passion or charismatic leaders or timing or precision viability modelling and the like.
I've [written before](http://danielcrenna.com/post/571641038/the-impossibility-gap) that there seems to be quite a lack of
people attempting the impossible. So we are all sitting here, with this massive opportunity to make better decisions, and
hence better software, by mining, extracting, and making sense of a neverending supply of information, but we end up making
'todo' lists and scheduling software; "it's like we have these big fangs and claws but we don't know how to kill the bunny". 

These kinds of web business projects are all well and good and are useful, profitable, and fun with the right motivation, and I 
won't deny that there's more to a successful business, more to what's non-reproducible and essential, than mere intellectual property, 
but Qualm is to satisfy that part of me that wants to get right into the thick of it and create things that didn't exist before,
to make things that are, at least for the moment, indistinguishable from magic. And the reality is that it's a pretty slim shot
that could happen. But I have to get up every morning and do it anyway, because that's what I love to do. And I couldn't imagine
starting a day doing anything else. You dig?

### Caveat Tractor

This is primarily a learning effort on the part of the author; choose wisely. This code was never designed
to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent any disease, nor was it made for "adoption", "traction", "community", or 
"neverending requests for help", as is the fate of certain other OSS projects. This code should be treated as if you 
just walked into a coffee shop, and noticed that the previous occupant of the seat you are taking has left quite a bit of 
personal writing on the table. It's MIT licensed personal writing, but you get the point; you read it, or you don't, but you 
certainly don't think to call them up to compare notes.

In other words, I'm not going to even bring up the fact that it's here. I hope that, as someone who's looking
for something like this, that you find it. I hope that it grows up to be a useful contribution, but I'm not going to be an 
overbearing parent about it. I would definitely appreciate hearing where I've made a mess of things, your suggestions, et al.,
but if I don't understand it completely, it won't end up in the code. If that's reprehensible to you, there's a "fork" button
that I think you'd really get a kick out of.

### Futher reading

I'm distilling my own learning journey through reading; lots and lots of reading. Beyond what I find online, I'm learning
quite a bit from the following books, which help me see topics from many angles before they turn into a kind of thought-putty
that forms into a single concept that might actually stick. So, if you're up for it, I recommend getting on the bus with these:

* _"Machine Learning in Action" by Peter Harrington (Manning)_
* _"Taming Text" by Grant S. Ingersoll, Thomas S. Morton, and Andrew L. Farris (Manning)_
* _"Programming Collective Intelligence" by Toby Segaran (O'Reilly)_
* _"Collective Intelligence in Action" by Satnam Alag (Manning)_
* _"Algorithms of the Intelligent Web" by Haralambos Marmanis and Dmitry Babenko (Manning)_
