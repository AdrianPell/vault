Open Source Vault
=================

This repository contains a large collection of shelved open source software that I've written since 2009.

Many were popular libraries downloaded over a hundred thousand times. Many were and still are little libraries I use often when I don't want to write the same code over and over again.

For various reasons, like technology churn, but mainly the amount of time and attention it takes to curate open source projects, projects come and go, interests wane, relentless requests for help from addled freelancers pile on...

I often hunt and peck through this code for projects as it contains perennial solutions to many common challenges, especially in web development (DI, caching, data connection scoping, bulk copying, et al.).

For the most part, every project in this vault has a separate README file so you get a sense of what it is used for.

However, all code in this repository is considered "final state". No pull requests or issues will be fielded. 

If you want to use from this repository, fork it, steal the code, and provide a citation for the project's respective license.

*All licenses and copyrights for respective sub-projects in this repo remain intact.*


A quick note about NuGet:
-------------------
Unfortunately, around a year ago, I accidentally lost one of my domains, a domain that was being used as the email account for
my NuGet account: https://www.nuget.org/profiles/apitize

I made several attempts to recover the account but NuGet management will not provide access.

Unfortunately, this means that I am not able to issue an update to any of the packages listed on that account, most of which are in this vault.

This means it is better for you, in the long run, to avoid those packages and use source code, as those packages are now also "final state" and will never receive another update.
